# Mouser/EPM Tech assessment

Changes/ Enhancements Suggested:
--------------------------------------

1. Error handling with Error Code:
2. Logging could be added , may be application insights or file logging as simple
3. Best way be to add a Service (Business layer) which handles the validation and business rules and Controller calls the business layer,
this would give the chance to add unit testing on the business layer with less effort compared to writing the unit test with controller.

--------------------------------------


The solution is written in VS2022 and .Net6

There are two controllers that need completing
 - WarehouseApi
    - There comments that document the required actions/endpoints
 - HomeController
    - Check the index view for the controller to see whats requested 

A DLL has been provided (EPM.Mouser.Interview.Data) which provides a data repo and some models
The data layer is 'faked' and initialized on startup so don't expect the same data between debug sessions (but it is persisted between requests).


Document any questions you'd ask and then also put your assumptions (in leau of asking the questions)
Feel free to also suggest what else could be done out side the scope of the requested changes.
Also document any enhacements you would apply.
